Changes for 1.9.6

.....


Please report any errors, glitches or alike as soon as you see one so I can fix it right away!
Also if you want to show off something amazing you made, don't be afraid to share so I can post it (pictures, mod showcase or anything else)!!!

Enjoy!!

To-do:
- [x] Removed Mithril entirely from the mod!
- [x] Added a new set of armor and tools (Fyrised) to replace the mithril armor and tools.
- [x] Added Soul Forest mod source to Github at : https://github.com/OwnAgePau/Soul-Forest
- [x] Added Set Bonus information to the item information that shows when you press the (default) F button.
- [x] Added spawned in altars to the Dark Caverns biome that currently only look a bit fancy. They will be used in multiple ways later on.
- [x] Added a new Achievement that can be achieved by killing the Ice Queen.
- [x] Added 2 (quite similar) new biomes (Soul Shrubbery & Fyrised Shrubbery).
- [x] Fixed the gemcutter only showing "burning particles" when not active, it instead shows it when the gemcutter is active.
- [x] Did some refactoring and cleanup
- [x] Reduced the rate at which Groundhog spawns reinforcements (as this was set to insanely fast by previous update).
- [x] Reduced the health of koteks (red, blue & green) by 50%.
- [x] Re-added fog into the dimension (green coloured fog) as it gives the dimension's atmosphere a little edge.
- [x] Added caves to the dimension to make it a little bit easier (and much safer) to find gems.
- [x] Changed Textures of : Hardwood (trees, leaves, planks, stairs), Laterite (dirt & grass) and the Ice Workbench.
- [x] Removed the lighting effect of the Ice Workbench.
- [x] Added a new boss: The Ice Queen.
- [x] The Ice Queen will:
	1. Summon a wall inbetween you and herself to block ranged attacks from coming in, and when she summons a new wall the old wall will explode and damage + slow you on hit.
	2. Summon either 2 Exclos's, 2 Ice Fairies or 2 Illusions/copies of herself.
		- The illusions will not summon anything, but they do teleport around. When you hit one of the illusions you will get blinded and damaged.
	3. Teleport away from you when you get too close (before you get in your melee attack range) or teleport closer to you when too far away.
- [x] Added a new item called the Ice Crystal that can be used to summon the Ice Queen. 
	You will need to build an altar and use the Ice Crystal on the middle block. Look at the picture to see what altar looks like.
- [x] Fixed different stuff generating above the world (on top of the netherack, including trees, flowers and structures).
- [x] Custom leaves no longer drop the leaves on destruction without the proper tool (berrycutter).
- [x] Made the custom leaves a bit less though to destroy by hand.
